# EarlyDiagnosisandPredictionofCervicalCancerthroughMlandDL
Early diagnosis and prediction of cervical cancer plays a crucial role in improving patient outcomes and reducing mortality rates. In this project, we employed various machine learning algorithms including Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, and a Sequential model to develop predictive models.
